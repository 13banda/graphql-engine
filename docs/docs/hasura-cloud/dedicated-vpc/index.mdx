# Dedicated VPC

<ProductBadge ee />

## Introduction

You can request a Dedicated VPC to be provisioned for you on Hasura Cloud so that you have better isolation in terms of
your project placement. You can also initiate VPC peering with you own networks for secure connectivity.

:::info Available on Hasura Cloud Enterprise

Dedicated VPC is only available as a part of the **[Cloud Enterprise](/hasura-cloud/overview.mdx/#cloud-enterprise)**
plan. Peering requests are available for **AWS** and **GCP**. [Contact Sales](https://hasura.io/contact-us/) to know
more.

## Creating a VPC

Once the feature is enabled for your account, you'll see a new tab on the dashboard called **VPCs**. All existing VPCs
can be found here. You can also initiate a request to create a new VPC. To request a new VPC, click on the **Create New
VPC** button on top. This will open a form with the following fields:

Enter the following details:

| Field          | Description                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloud Provider | The cloud provider where the VPC should be provisioned.                                                       |
| Region         | The region where the VPC should be provisioned (note that projects will also be created in this region, too). |
| VPC Name       | A display name for Hasura Dashboard.                                                                          |
| VPC CIDR       | A valid private IPV4 address range (/16) that should be used with this VPC.                                   |

:::info Examples of IP ranges

For example `172.16.0.0/16`, `10.10.0.0/16` are valid CIDR ranges. However, it cannot be `10.2.0.0/16`.

Additionally, your VPC CIDR cannot conflict with VPCs that you intend to peer with _this_ VPC.

:::

Once you submit the request, the VPC will appear as `Pending`. It will take about 10-20 minutes for your VPC to be
provisioned. Once it is provisioned, you will be able to see the VPC's details from your Cloud dashboard and create
peering and projects.

If the provisioning fails, you'll see the VPC in a `Failed` state. [Reach out to support](https://hasura.io/help/) to
resolve this.

## Create projects within the VPC

Once the VPC is provisioned, create a project by clicking on the **New Project** button in VPC details screen or
[get in touch with us](https://hasura.io/help/) to migrate your existing Hasura Project to the VPC.
